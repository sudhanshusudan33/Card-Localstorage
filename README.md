# Local Storage Data Management with Animation

This project demonstrates how to manage user data using local storage in a web application. It includes features to save, retrieve, and clear user data such as first name, last name, country, phone number, state, city, and village. The application also incorporates simple animations for a better user experience.

## Features

## Usage

### Loading Data

When you first load the application, it will prompt you to enter your first name, last name, country, phone number, state, city, and village through alert boxes. This data will be saved in the local storage and displayed on the page.

### Clearing Data

To clear the stored data, click on the "Clear Data" button. This will remove all the user data from the local storage and refresh the page, prompting you to enter the data again.

### Animation Effects

- The main container fades in when the page loads.
- The "Clear Data" button contains an icon that flips horizontally when hovered over.

## Customization

### Changing the Icon

Replace the `clear_icon.png` file in the project directory with your preferred icon. Ensure the icon file name and extension are correctly referenced in the `index.html` file.
